## Hello,
Welcome to my first interactive mobile-friendly miniproject, using *bootstrap 4*, *fontawesome, *googlefonts, and some of my own coding as well.
python3 -m http.server

## Code Institute
Thanks to CodeInstitute, as this was a mini project I completed in the User Centric Front End Developement Module.

**31st March 2020:** Completed the mini project in time for my Milestone project, which is based on the same topic; User Centric Front End Developement.

**Link** Added a link to my finished mini project here: https://shaamuus.github.io/UCD-resume/

Happy viewing!
